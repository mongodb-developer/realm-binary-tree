# BinaryTree

A simple implementation of a Realm-backed [Binary Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree).

This library __is a demo on how to use DocC__. See beelow how your new docs will look! üëá

You can read a series of posts about how to create a small guessing game in the Realm/MongoDB blog, starting with [Creating a framework that uses Realm as a 3rd party dependency](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/how-to/adding-realm-as-dependency-ios-framework/)

## Realm + Swift Packages

Also it shows how to integrate and use Realm in your Swift Packages. For details, have a look at [Package.swift](./Package.swift)

## Generating DocC using Github Actions

This repo also has a Github Action to automatically generate the DocC docs on each push. You can read about this in the [MongoDB Developer Center](https://www.mongodb.com/developer) article [Continuously Building and Hosting our Swift DocC Documentation using Github Actions and Netlify](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/swift/build-host-docc-documentation-using-github-actions-netlify/)

For the impatient, check the [`main.yml` file](./.github/workflows/main.yml)

Generated DocC files can be found [in this repo](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/realm-binary-tree-docc)

## Local testing

Every time you build the documentation from Xcode the documentation browser will allow you to check how your docs look. [You can export the docs as a Documentation Archive](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/distributing-documentation-to-external-developers).

But this docs are a web site that we can serve locally. Let's see how to do it using Docker

To host your generated docs in a local web server, if you have Docker installed you can create your own image or mount the generated doc folder

### Creating an Image

Create an image based on this Docker file: it'll have an Apache httpd server and the doccarchive files

```bash
docker build -t docs .
```

then run the image in a container

```bash
docker run -dit --name my-running-app -p 8080:80 docs
```

### Mounting the generated doc folder

```bash
docker run -dit -v /Users/dfreniche/Code/DocC/BinaryTree/docs/BinaryTree.doccarchive:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/  -p 8080:80 httpd:2.4
```

Change the path to where you exported the doccarchive

- To access the documentation, navigate to: http://localhost:8080/documentation/binarytree/
- To access the tutorials: http://localhost:8080/tutorials/binarytree/
