You can read a series of posts about how to create a small guessing game in the Realm/MongoDB blog, starting with [Creating a framework that uses Realm as a 3rd party dependency](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/how-to/adding-realm-as-dependency-ios-framework/)

## Realm + Swift Packages

Also it shows how to integrate and use Realm in your Swift Packages. For details, have a look at [Package.swift](./Package.swift)

## Generating DocC using Github Actions

This repo also has a Github Action to automatically generate the DocC docs on each push. You can read about this in the [MongoDB Developer Center](https://www.mongodb.com/developer) article [Continuously Building and Hosting our Swift DocC Documentation using Github Actions and Netlify](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/swift/build-host-docc-documentation-using-github-actions-netlify/)

For the impatient, check the [`main.yml` file](./.github/workflows/main.yml)

Generated DocC files can be found [in this repo](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/realm-binary-tree-docc)
